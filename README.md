# 🩺 Multi-Modal AI Chatbot for Skin Disease Diagnosis

> A smart, explainable, and accessible AI-powered solution for dermatology

---

## 🚀 Overview

This project presents a **multi-modal, AI-integrated chatbot system** that enhances the accuracy, usability, and accessibility of **skin disease diagnosis**. It combines **image analysis** with **natural language symptom interpretation**, offering a more comprehensive diagnostic approach than traditional single-modality systems.

---

## 🔍 Key Features

- 📸 **Vision Transformer (ViT)**  
  Processes skin lesion images with state-of-the-art visual understanding.

- 🗣️ **BERT Language Model**  
  Understands user-described symptoms in natural language.

- 🔗 **Dual-Modality Fusion**  
  Combines outputs of ViT and BERT using an **ensemble learning strategy** for accurate and holistic predictions.

- 💬 **GPT-Powered Chatbot Interface**  
  Conversational interface makes symptom reporting intuitive, user-friendly, and accessible—even for non-experts.

- 🧠 **Explainable AI (XAI)**
  - **Grad-CAM**: Highlights key regions in images influencing the prediction.
  - **BERT Attention Maps**: Shows critical symptom phrases used in text analysis.

- 📱 **Mobile & Offline Compatibility**  
  Built using **TensorFlow Lite** for **real-time**, low-resource deployment—ideal for rural or underserved areas.

## 💡 Why It Matters

Traditional diagnostic systems often misfire when diseases share similar visual traits. Our **dual-input model** overcomes this by factoring in both what patients *see* and *feel*. The result?  
- **Greater diagnostic accuracy**  
- **Explainability that builds trust**  
- **Wider accessibility for global healthcare equity**
